//! **petgraph** is a graph data structure library.
//!
//! The most prominent type is [**Graph**](./graph/struct.Graph.html) which is
//! a directed or undirected graph with arbitrary mutable node and edge weights.
//! It is based on rustc's graph implementation.
//!
//! Petgraph also provides:
//!
//! - [**GraphMap**](./graphmap/struct.GraphMap.html) - an undirected
//! hashmap-backed graph which only allows simple node identifiers (such as
//! integers or references).
//! - [**Dag**](./dag/struct.Dag.html) - a thin wrapper around **Graph**,
//! providing a refined API for dealing specifically with directed acyclic
//! graphs (aka DAGs).
